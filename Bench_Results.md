I've just been doing some basic benchmarking on this project.  My professor told me about the existence of --release as an argument when compiling.  After performing rudimentary and non-scientific tests, it is looking like this makes the algorithm 1000% faster.

With this performance improvement, I have found that the mean number of generations needed to perfectly match a string of length 50 is 12,852.  A comparison to the Python implementation is soon to follow.
